This is the directory for Tmux Configuration. I use the Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM) as well as some plugins. I made this conf to don't interfere with Emacs, and to enable emacs-like behaviour in Tmux.

Have fun!

* Setup
** General
Just place the file in =~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf=. Tmux will recognize it automatically. You can of course put it somewhere else. However, please note that some paths in the file are hard-coded, so change them accordingly.
** TPM
1. Create the directory: =~/.config/tmux/plugins=
2. Run: =git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.config/tmux/plugins/tpm=
3. Open Tmux and install plugins with =prefix + I=

** Errors
*** TPM returns 1
This is an issue related to tmux-mem-cpu-load. Install cmake to fix it or disable the plugin. Issue: https://github.com/thewtex/tmux-mem-cpu-load/issues/55
