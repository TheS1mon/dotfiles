Here is the place where I put my config files. I will add content to this readme including directory structure, once there is more data to write about.

* Rights to use
Feel free to include the dotfiles in your projects or to get inspiration from them. However, I won't provide any warranty on the quality of them.
They are my personnel files and I try to keep them up to date with general security/implementation recommendations, but there is no guarantee on that.
