* DrDos's Dotfiles
Here is the place I put my config files. I will add a content to this readme including directory structure once there is more data to write about.

* Rights to use
Feel free to include the dotfiles in your projects, or to get inspiration from them. However, I wont provide any warranty on the quality of them.
They are my personal files and I try to keep them up to date with general security/implementation recommendations, but there is no garantee on that.
