Here is the place where I put my config files.

* Directory layout
#+begin_example
dotfiles/
├── emacs/           Emacs configuration
├── tmux/            tmux configuration
└── README.org       this file
#+end_example

* Rights to use
Feel free to include the dotfiles in your projects or to get inspiration from them. However, I won't provide any warranty on the quality of them.
They are my personnel files and I try to keep them up to date with general security/implementation recommendations, but there is no guarantee on that.

* Quick start
#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://github.com/therealdrdos/dotfiles ~/Somewhereonyourmachine
#+end_src  
  Consult the readme files for each conf you want to use, there may be specific instructions.
  Or use some app like GNU stow to manage them.
